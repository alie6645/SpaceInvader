# SpaceInvader
basic JSwing version of Space Invaders

**Bugs**
- Sometimes frame is blank at launch, running it again usually fixes it
  - I don't know why it does that
- Possibility of concurrent modification of enemy list in collision checking
  - Probably just thread issues, remove enhanced for loop?

**Done**
- Enemy movement
- Player movement
- Player projectiles

**To Do**
- Enemy projectiles
- Point System
- Game Over (lives or smthn)
- Waves

**Maybe**
- Powerups
- Sounds
- Improve Sprites
